# AGEPRO
The ApplyBB_CR.R code uses a pre-existing, functional AgePro .INP file, but iteratively runs AgePro to automate the application of a status (i.e., biomass-based; B/Bmsy) based harvest control rule.  AgePro is then reapplied with the catch that results from the control rule in year y+1 (year y is the "bridge" year) used in all years (i.e., a constant catch, at least in the short-term).  Lastly, AgePro is reapplied to each of the above situations to calcuate the annual OFLs.  The result is tables with short-term projection results.  The Analyze_AgePro.R and ProjectionTables.Rmd files contain functions that apply the control rule, calculate median and CIs for age pros runs, and create the tables.  These files are "sourced" in the ApplyBB_CR.R file.
